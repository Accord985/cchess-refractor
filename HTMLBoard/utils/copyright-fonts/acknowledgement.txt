None of these fonts were uploaded to github. It seems, according to the copyright
holders, that using those fonts in an app requires me to purchase a special
permission. This is just a hobby project, and I don't want to be sued for font
copyright infringement. As a result, the fonts will not work. You need to
download the fonts file (.ttf) yourself.

Later I might (or might not) design the pieces look on my own, and at that time
they would be available online.
